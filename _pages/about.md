I am a Lead Data Scientist at [Motilal Oswal Financial Services](https://www.motilaloswal.com/) in Mumbai, India, where I work on building recommender systems and personalization solutions.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Information Retrieval**, and **Recommender Systems**, with a specific focus on user modeling and personalization. I am passionate about developing intelligent systems that understand user preferences and deliver tailored experiences.

I am pursuing an M.Tech from [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/), UK, and hold a B.Tech from [Pandit Deendayal Energy University](https://www.pdpu.ac.in/) (formerly PDPU), Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.
